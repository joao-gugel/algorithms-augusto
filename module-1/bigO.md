## Big O Notation

Calculates the time and space complexity of an algorithm.

If you need to pass between all the elements (n) of a list, you get an BigO(n) time complexity.

If you only needs to allocate an item from a list in the memory, your space big O complexity is O(1).

O(1) -> Constant time: It's the faster way to solve a problem.
O(n) -> Linear time: The time complexity increases in linear time.
O(log n) -> Logarithmic time: The time complexity increases in logarithmic time, the runtime isn't proportional to the size of the input.
O(n log n) -> Linearithmic time: Scales on linear and logarithmic time
