## Hashmap

An object that contain non-repeated keys that points to a value.

Normally, the reading time complexity is O(1)

```typescript
const userFavoriteColors = {
  joao: "blue",
  pedro: "brown",
};
```

A hash function will transform the key in a value and this value it's be the position of the key that we want, in an array.

I NEED TO STUDY MORE ABOUT IT.
