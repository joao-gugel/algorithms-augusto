## Binary Tree

Starts with a node that have two sides (right and left), that points to other nodes with two sides too.

It's like a linked list with two sides.

```typescript
const example = {
  head: {
    value: 10,
    right: {
      value: 20
      next: {
        value: 30,
        right: null
        left: null
      }
    }
    left: null
  }
}
```
